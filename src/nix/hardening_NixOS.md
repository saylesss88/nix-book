Securing your NixOS system begins with a philosophy of minimalism, explicit
configuration, and proactive control.

Containers and VMs are beyond the scope of this chapter but can also enhance
security if configured correctly.

## Minimal Installation with LUKS

Begin with NixOS’s minimal installation image. This gives you a base system with
only essential tools and no extras that could introduce vulnerabilities.

Use LUKS encryption to protect your data at rest, the following guide is a
minimal disko encrypted installation:
[Encrypted Install](https://saylesss88.github.io/installation/enc/enc_install.html)

## Secure Boot

![Virus](../images/virus1.png)

Secure Boot helps ensure only signed, trusted kernels and bootloaders are
executed at startup.

Useful Resources:

- [The Strange State of Authenticated Boot and Encryption](https://0pointer.net/blog/authenticated-boot-and-disk-encryption-on-linux.html)

- [NixOS Wiki Secure Boot](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Secure_Boot)

- [lanzaboote repo](https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote)

Practical Lanzaboote Secure Boot setup for NixOS:
[Guide:Secure Boot on NixOS with Lanzaboote](https://saylesss88.github.io/installation/enc/lanzaboote.html)

## Encrypted Secrets

Never store secrets in plain text in repositories. Use something like
`sops-nix`, which lets you keep encrypted secrets under version control
declaratively.

Protect your sectets, the following guide is on setting up Sops on NixOS:
[Sops Encrypted Secrets](https://saylesss88.github.io/installation/enc/sops-nix.html)

## Hardening the Kernel

From the following discourse, it looks like the following is now enabled by
default
[Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/enabling-hardened-profile/63107):

```nix
profiles.hardened.enable = true;
```

- There is a proposal to remove it FYI:
  [Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/proposal-to-deprecate-the-hardened-profile/63081)

You can also use the hardened kernel:

```nix
boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_latest_hardened;
```

Check all `sysctl` parameters:

```bash
sysctl -a
```

Check Active Linux Security Modules:

```bash
cat /sys/kernel/security/lsm
```

Check Kernel Configuration Options:

```bash
zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX
zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY
zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR
```

**Or** you can harden the kernel you're using:

```nix
  boot.kernel.sysctl = {
    # The Magic SysRq key is a key combo that allows users connected to the
    # system console of a Linux kernel to perform some low-level commands.
    # Disable it, since we don't need it, and is a potential security concern.
    "kernel.sysrq" = 0;
    "fs.protected_fifos" = 2;
    "fs.protected_regular" = 2;
    "fs.suid_dumpable" = false;
    "kernel.kptr_restrict" = 2;
    # Note: certian container runtimes or browser sandboxes might rely on the following
    "kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled" = true;

    ## TCP hardening
    # Prevent bogus ICMP errors from filling up logs.
    "net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses" = 1;
    # Reverse path filtering causes the kernel to do source validation of
    # packets received from all interfaces. This can mitigate IP spoofing.
    "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding" = 0;
    "net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter" = 1;
    "net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter" = 1;
    # Do not accept IP source route packets (we're not a router)
    "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route" = 0;
    "net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route" = 0;
    "net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding" = 0;
    # Don't send ICMP redirects (again, we're not a router)
    "net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects" = 0;
    "net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects" = 0;
    # "net.core.bpf_jit_harden" = 2;
    # Refuse ICMP redirects (MITM mitigations)
    "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects" = 0;
    "net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects" = 0;
    "net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects" = 0;
    "net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects" = 0;
    "net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects" = 0;
    "net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects" = 0;
    # Protects against SYN flood attacks
    "net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies" = 1;
    # Incomplete protection again TIME-WAIT assassination
    "net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337" = 1;
    # disable unprivileged user namespaces, Note: Docker, and other apps may need this
    "kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone" = 0;
    # memory protection (64-bit systems)
    "vm.mmap_rnd_bits" = 32;
    # Randomize memory
    "kernel.randomize_va_space" = 2;
    # Exec Shield (Stack protection)
    "kernel.exec-shield" = 1;
    "kernel.randomize_va_space" = 2;


    ## TCP optimization
    # TCP Fast Open is a TCP extension that reduces network latency by packing
    # data in the sender’s initial TCP SYN. Setting 3 = enable TCP Fast Open for
    # both incoming and outgoing connections:
    "net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen" = 3;
    # Bufferbloat mitigations + slight improvement in throughput & latency
    "net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control" = "bbr";
    "net.core.default_qdisc" = "cake";
  };
```

Note: The above settings are fairly aggressive and can break common programs, I
attempted to leave comment warnings.

## Best Practices

**Explicitly enable each service**: In your `configuration.nix`, only enable
networking, SSH, desktop environments, and applications as needed. Remove or
avoid legacy daemons and sample services.

**Principle of Least Privilege Limit installed software**: Each program or
service added is potential attack surface. Install packages individually rather
than enabling broad module imports or convenience meta-packages.

**Run services as unprivileged users**: Wherever possible, configure system
services to run with a dedicated user and group, not as root.

**Use NixOS’s fine-grained service options**: For example, set systemd
sandboxing options (ProtectHome, PrivateTmp, NoNewPrivileges), and use NixOS
modules’ user/group settings for daemons.

**Secure the Boot & Init Process Enable Secure Boot**: Use modules like
lanzaboote to enforce EFI Secure Boot, ensuring only signed kernels are loaded.

**Encrypt your root and data partitions**: Use LUKS to encrypt your partitions,
some even encrypt their swap.

Keep the Attack Surface Small Disable unused features and daemons: Comment out
or set `enable = false;` for modules like CUPS, Samba, avahi, etc., if you don’t
need printing, filesharing, or zeroconf networking.

**Use HTTPS**: This one is simple but has big benifits, there is usually an
extension or setting for this on most browsers. It ensures that all data
exchanged between your browser and the website you're visiting is encrypted.
This means that if it's intercepted, they won't be able to read your data.

## Hardening Systemd

![Hacker](../images/hacker.png)

`systemd` is the core "init system" and service manager that controls how
services, daemons, and basic system processes are started, stopped and
supervised on modern Linux distributions, including NixOS.

`systemd` is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a
system and service manager that runs as `PID 1` and starts the rest of the
system.

Because it launches and supervises almost all system services, hardening systemd
means raising the baseline security of your entire system.

`dbus-broker` is generally considered more secure and robust but isn't the
default as of yet. To set `dbus-broker` as the default:

```nix
  users.groups.netdev = {};
  services = {
    usbguard.enable = false;
    dbus.implementation = "broker";
    logrotate.enable = true;
    journald = {
      storage = "volatile"; # Store logs in memory
      upload.enable = false; # Disable remote log upload (the default)
    };
  };
```

- `dbus-broker` is more resilient to resource exhaustion attacks and integrates
  better with Linux security features.

- Setting `storage = "volatile"` tells journald to keep log data only in memory.
  There is a tradeoff though, If you need long-term auditing or troubleshooting
  after a reboot, this will not preserve system logs.

- `upload.enable` is for forwarding log messages to remote servers, setting this
  to false prevents accidental leaks of potentially sensitive or internal system
  information.

- Enabling `logrotate` prevents your disk from filling with excessive
  legacy/service log files.

You can check the security status with:

```bash
systemd-analyze security
# or for a detailed view of individual services security posture
systemd-analyze security NetworkManager
```

Further reading on systemd:

- [systemd.io](https://systemd.io/)

- [Rethinking PID 1](https://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd.html)

- [Biggest Myths about Systemd](https://0pointer.de/blog/projects/the-biggest-myths.html)

The following is a repo containing many of the Systemd hardening settings in
NixOS format:

[nix-system-services-hardened](https://github.com/wallago/nix-system-services-hardened)

For example, to harden bluetooth you could add the following to your
`configuration.nix` or equivalent:

```nix
systemd.services = {
      bluetooth.serviceConfig = {
      ProtectKernelTunables = lib.mkDefault true;
      ProtectKernelModules = lib.mkDefault true;
      ProtectKernelLogs = lib.mkDefault true;
      ProtectHostname = true;
      ProtectControlGroups = true;
      ProtectProc = "invisible";
      SystemCallFilter = [
        "~@obsolete"
        "~@cpu-emulation"
        "~@swap"
        "~@reboot"
        "~@mount"
      ];
      SystemCallArchitectures = "native";
    };
}
```

As you can see from above, you typically use the `serviceConfig` attribute to
harden settings for systemd services.

```bash
systemd-analyze security bluetooth
→ Overall exposure level for bluetooth.service: 3.3 OK 🙂
```

## Lynis and other tools

Lynis is a security auditing tool for systems based on UNIX like Linux, macOS,
BSD, and others.--[lynis repo](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis)

Installation:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
pkgs.lynis
pkgs.chkrootkit
pkgs.clamav
pkgs.aide
 ];
```

Usage:

```bash
sudo lynis show commands
sudo lynis audit system
 Lynis security scan details:

  Hardening index : 78 [###############     ]
  Tests performed : 231
  Plugins enabled : 0

  Components:
  - Firewall               [V]
  - Malware scanner        [V]
```

- Lynis will give you more recommendations for securing your system as well.

Example cron job for `chkrootkit`:

```nix
{pkgs, ...}: {
  services.cron = {
    enable = true;
    # messages.enable = true;
    systemCronJobs = [
      # Every Sunday at 2:10 AM, run chkrootkit as root, log output for review
      "10 2 * * 0 root ${pkgs.chkrootkit}/bin/chkrootkit | logger -t chkrootkit"
    ];
  };
}
```

The above cron job will use `chkrootkit` to automatically scan for known rootkit
signatures. It can detect hidden processes and network connections.

I got the recommendation for `clamav` from the Paranoid NixOS blog post and the
others help with compliance for `lynis`.

## Hardening Networking

## Encrypted DNS

The
[Domain Name System (DNS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/)
is the address book of the Internet. When you visit cloudflare.com or any other
site, your browser will ask a DNS resolver for the IP address where the website
can be found. Unfortunately, these DNS queries and answers are typically
unprotected. Encrypting DNS would improve user privacy and security. In this
post, we will look at two mechanisms for encrypting DNS, known as
[DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-over-tls/),
and explain how they
work.--[Cloudflare Dns Encryption Explained](https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/)

The following sets up dnscrypt-proxy using DoH (DNS over HTTPS) with an oisd
blocklist:

Add `oisd` to your flake inputs:

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs = {
    oisd = {
      url = "https://big.oisd.nl/domainswild";
      flake = false;
    };
};
```

And the import the following into your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
# dnscrypt-proxy.nix
{
  pkgs,
  lib,
  inputs,
  ...
}: let
  blocklist_base = builtins.readFile inputs.oisd;
  extraBlocklist = '''';
  blocklist_txt = pkgs.writeText "blocklist.txt" ''
    ${extraBlocklist}
    ${blocklist_base}
  '';
  hasIPv6Internet = true;
  StateDirectory = "dnscrypt-proxy";
in {
  networking = {
    # Set DNS nameservers to the local host addresses for iPv4 (`127.0.0.1`) & iPv6 (::1)
    nameservers = ["127.0.0.1" "::1"];
    # If using dhcpcd
    # dhcpcd.extraConfig = "nohook resolv.conf";
    # If using NetworkManager
    networkmanager.dns = "none";
  };
  services.resolved.enable = lib.mkForce false;
  # See https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Encrypted_DNS
  services.dnscrypt-proxy2 = {
    enable = true;
    # See https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-proxy/example-dnscrypt-proxy.toml
    settings = {
      sources.public-resolvers = {
        urls = [
          "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/master/v3/public-resolvers.md"
          "https://download.dnscrypt.info/resolvers-list/v3/public-resolvers.md"
        ];
        minisign_key = "RWQf6LRCGA9i53mlYecO4IzT51TGPpvWucNSCh1CBM0QTaLn73Y7GFO3"; # See https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/blob/master/v3/public-resolvers.md
        cache_file = "/var/lib/${StateDirectory}/public-resolvers.md";
      };

      # Use servers reachable over IPv6 -- Do not enable if you don't have IPv6 connectivity
      ipv6_servers = hasIPv6Internet;
      block_ipv6 = ! hasIPv6Internet;
      blocked_names.blocked_names_file = blocklist_txt;
      require_dnssec = true;
      require_nolog = false;
      require_nofilter = true;
      doh_servers = true;
      odoh_servers = false;
      force_tcp = true;

      # If you want, choose a specific set of servers that come from your sources.
      # Here it's from https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/blob/master/v3/public-resolvers.md
      # If you don't specify any, dnscrypt-proxy will automatically rank servers
      # that match your criteria and choose the best one.
      # server_names = [ ... ];
    };
  };

  systemd.services.dnscrypt-proxy2.serviceConfig.StateDirectory = StateDirectory;
}
```

```bash
sudo systemctl status dnscrypt-proxy2
# verify that dnscrypt-proxy is listening
sudo ss -lnp | grep 53
# Test a DNS query, if you get valid responses it's working
dig @127.0.0.1 example.com +short
# check the logs
sudo journalctl -u dnscrypt-proxy2
```

`dnscrypt-proxy2` acts as your local DNS caching resolver.

All DNS clients on your system (`dig`, `curl`, most apps, except Firefox which
has its own proxy) use `dnscrypt-proxy2`.

`dnscrypt-proxy2` filters ads/trackers (using oisd), enforces DNSSEC, and uses
encrypted transports (DNS-over-HTTPS/DoH, DNSCrypt, optionally
DNS-over-TLS/DoT).

## Proxy Servers

Proxy servers let you control, monitor, or anonymize network traffic between
clients and the wider internet. In NixOS, you can set up various types of
proxies (HTTP, SOCKS, transparent, caching, privacy-focused) declaratively in
your system config.

Types of Proxy Servers: HTTP/HTTPS Forward Proxy, Controls and filters outbound
web traffic from client machines (e.g., for content filtering or caching).

SOCKS Proxy: Works for all TCP traffic, commonly used for anonymity or routing
through Tor.

Reverse Proxy: Handles incoming web traffic to one or more backend services
(usually handled by NGINX, Apache, Caddy).

Popular Proxy Packages on NixOS Squid (caching HTTP proxy)

Privoxy (privacy-enhancing HTTP proxy; can chain with Tor)

shadowsocks-libev (SOCKS5 proxy for privacy/bypassing censorship)

3proxy (lightweight multiprotocol proxy)

Tor (SOCKS5 proxy with strong anonymity)

TODO: Provide a Proxy Server Example

## Firewalls

[Cloudflare What is a Firewall](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-a-firewall/)

NixOS includes an integrated firewall based on iptables/nftables.

[Beginners guide to nftables](https://linux-audit.com/networking/nftables/nftables-beginners-guide-to-traffic-filtering/)

[Arch Wiki nftables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nftables)

The following firewall setup is based on the dnscrypt setup above utilizing
nftables:

```nix
{...}: {
  networking.nftables = {
    enable = true;

    ruleset = ''
      table inet filter {
        chain output {
          # Allow localhost DNS for dnscrypt-proxy2
          ip daddr 127.0.0.1 udp dport 53 accept
          ip6 daddr ::1 udp dport 53 accept
          ip daddr 127.0.0.1 tcp dport 53 accept
          ip6 daddr ::1 tcp dport 53 accept
          # Allow dnscrypt-proxy2 to talk to upstream
          # ps -o uid,user,pid,cmd -C dnscrypt-proxy; Copy UID #
          meta skuid 62396 udp dport { 443, 853 } accept
          meta skuid 62396 tcp dport { 443, 853 } accept
          # Block all other outbound DNS
          udp dport { 53, 853 } drop
          tcp dport { 53, 853 } drop
        }
      }
    '';
  };

  networking.firewall = {
    enable = true;
    allowedTCPPorts = [
      53 # DNS
      22 # SSH
      80 # HTTP
      443 # HTTPS
    ];
    allowedUDPPorts = [
      53 # DNS
    ];
  };
}
```

The firewall ensures only your authorized, local encrypted DNS proxy process can
speak DNS with the outside world, and that all other DNS requests from any other
process are blocked unless they're to `127.0.0.1` (our local proxy). This is a
robust policy against both DNS leaks and local compromise.

Review listening ports: After each rebuild, use `ss -tlpn` or `netstat` to see
which services are accepting connections. Close or firewall anything
unnecessary.

Use the built-in firewall: Enable and configure networking.firewall to allow
only explicitly required ports.

## Firejail

Firejail is a SUID program that reduces the risk of security breaches by
restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using
[Linux namespaces](https://lwn.net/Articles/531114/) and
[seccomp-bpf](https://l3net.wordpress.com/2015/04/13/firejail-seccomp-guide/)--[Firejail Security Sandbox](https://firejail.wordpress.com/)

It provides sandboxing and access restriction per application, much like what
AppArmor/SELinux does at a kernel level. However, it's not as secure or
comprehensive as kernel-enforced MAC systems (AppArmor/SELinux), since it's a
userspace tool and can potentially be bypassed by privilege escalation exploits.

## Securing SSH

First of all, if you don't use SSH don't enable it in the first place. If you do
use SSH, it's important to understand what that opens you up to.

The following are some recommendations from Mozilla on OpenSSH:

- [Mozilla OpenSSH guidelines](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/openssh.html)

The following OpenSSH setup is based on the above guidelines with strong
algorithms, and best practices:

```nix
{config, ...}: {
  config = {
    services = {
      fail2ban = {
        enable = true;
        maxretry = 5;
        bantime = "1h";
        # ignoreIP = [
        # "172.16.0.0/12"
        # "192.168.0.0/16"
        # "2601:881:8100:8de0:31e6:ac52:b5be:462a"
        # "matrix.org"
        # "app.element.io" # don't ratelimit matrix users
        # ];

        bantime-increment = {
          enable = true; # Enable increment of bantime after each violation
          multipliers = "1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256";
          maxtime = "168h"; # Do not ban for more than 1 week
          overalljails = true; # Calculate the bantime based on all the violations
        };
      };
      openssh = {
        enable = true;
        settings = {
          PasswordAuthentication = false;
          PermitEmptyPasswords = false;
          PermitTunnel = false;
          UseDns = false;
          KbdInteractiveAuthentication = false;
          X11Forwarding = config.services.xserver.enable;
          MaxAuthTries = 3;
          MaxSessions = 2;
          ClientAliveInterval = 300;
          ClientAliveCountMax = 0;
          AllowUsers = ["your-user"];
          TCPKeepAlive = false;
          AllowTcpForwarding = false;
          AllowAgentForwarding = false;
          LogLevel = "VERBOSE";
          PermitRootLogin = "no";

          ];
        };
        hostKeys = [
          {
            path = "/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key";
            type = "ed25519";
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Harden Authentication and Access Use key-based SSH, disable passwords: Set
`services.openssh.settings.PasswordAuthentication = false;` and use SSH keys
generated with strong algorithms (e.g., Ed25519).

Restrict SSH access: Use AllowUsers, limit sources with firewall rules, and
disable root login.

Use multi-factor authentication (MFA): For both SSH and desktop login,
optionally integrate U2F, TOTP, or smartcard support.

System Update and Maintenance Regularly update and upgrade: Use nixos-rebuild
frequently and review channel or flake updates to patch vulnerabilities quickly.

Audit installed packages: Use `nix-store --gc` and `nix-collect-garbage` to
minimize leftover, unused software.

Automate security updates: Consider scheduled builds or notifications for NixOS
security advisories.

Monitoring, Logging, and Auditing Enable audit logging: Set
`security.auditd.enable = true;` for system-level event logging.

**Monitor denied accesses**: Configure `security.apparmor` or `security.selinux`
as a mandatory access control layer, and regularly check logs for AppArmor or
SELinux policy denials.

**Review logs with `journalctl`**: Check system logs for unauthorized access
attempts or configuration errors.

Advanced Hardening Implement sandboxing: For server workloads or exposed
applications, consider running them in `systemd-nspawn`, Firejail, or with user
namespaces for isolation.

Deploy mandatory access control (MAC): Enable and tune AppArmor or SELinux for
application-level confinement. Write or port profiles for critical apps and
services.

## USB Port Protection

```bash
nix-shell -p usbguard
```

```bash
sudo usbguard generate-policy > ~/usbguard-rules.conf
```

> 🚧 Make sure not to just enable this, you need to set up rules or you can end
> up with some persistent problems.

Control USB/Removable access: Use `services.usbguard` to restrict which USB
devices are accepted. Be particularly careful if your authentication keyfiles
are on USB devices.

## USB interfaces

Usbguard can whitelist wanted usb devices and block the rest. Be careful here,
don't just enable it without adding rules.

```bash
sudo usbguard generate-policy > /etc/usbguard/rules.conf
```

For example:

```nix
{pkgs, ...}: {
  environment.systemPackages = [pkgs.usbguard-notifier];
  services.usbguard = {
    enable = true;
    rules = ''
      allow id 1d6b:0002 serial "0000:05:00.3" name "xHCI Host Controller" hash "4a4NgfdUaJO43rkCzmWRSeHHR/uUh5+SNsXnhosm9qs=" parent-hash "ldMchY4Tt4GPUYo30eNGvai+Fs/EdnVY3vMyxJUq4Nk=" with-interface 09:00:00 with-connect-type ""
      allow id 1d6b:0003 serial "0000:05:00.3" name "xHCI Host Controller" hash "d+DNGWARDtv9nEK2ZvnNOCtFernuMu5/e/oZ7kCppqQ=" parent-hash "ldMchY4Tt4GPUYo30eNGvai+Fs/EdnVY3vMyxJUq4Nk=" with-interface 09:00:00 with-connect-type ""
      # Add default policy
      block unknown
    '';
    # Optional: Configure these as needed for your security posture
    presentDevicePolicy = "apply-policy"; # Or "keep"
    IPCAllowedGroups = ["usbguard" "wheel"]; # If you want wheel group to manage
  };

  # If your user needs to interact with usbguard (e.g., via usbguard-cli)
  users.users.jr.extraGroups = ["usbguard"];
}
```

## SeLinux/AppArmor MAC (Mandatory Access Control)

**AppArmor**: Stable, supported, easier for most users; enable with one line,
but profile coverage may be incomplete. From my understanding the main issue is
that there are no default profiles so you have to write your own and since
apparmor.d isn't fully supported it makes it a bit more complicated.

I was able to get it configured for `sshd` with the following:

```nix

{
  pkgs,
  lib,
  config,
  ...
}: {
  # Enable AppArmor support in D-Bus
  services.dbus.apparmor = "enabled";
  security = {
    apparmor = {
      enable = true;
      enableCache = true;
      killUnconfinedConfinables = true;

      # Only need packages that provide real, used profiles and tools
      packages = with pkgs; [apparmor-utils apparmor-profiles];

      includes = {
        "abstractions/base" = ''
          /nix/store/*/bin/** mr,
          /nix/store/*/lib/** mr,
          /nix/store/** r,
          ${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/* rix,
          ${pkgs.coreutils-full}/bin/* rix,
        '';
      };

      # Example starter policies
      policies = {
        sshd = {
          profile = ''
            #include <tunables/global>
            /run/current-system/sw/bin/sshd {
              /nix/store/** rix,
              # ...
            }
          '';
          # Optionally, you may be able to add (if supported):
          # enforce = true;
          # enable = true;
        };

      };
    };
  };

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    apparmor-utils
    apparmor-parser
    apparmor-profiles
    # Optional: community/contrib profiles you intend to use
    # roddhjav-apparmor-rules # incomplete apparmor.d
  ];

  # If you want PAM integration (useful)
  security.pam = {
    services.sshd.enableAppArmor = true;
  };
}
```

```bash
sudo aa-status
apparmor module is loaded.
1 profiles are loaded.
1 profiles are in enforce mode.
   /run/current-system/sw/bin/sshd
0 profiles are in complain mode.
0 profiles are in prompt mode.
0 profiles are in kill mode.
0 profiles are in unconfined mode.
0 processes have profiles defined.
0 processes are in enforce mode.
0 processes are in complain mode.
0 processes are in prompt mode.
0 processes are in kill mode.
0 processes are unconfined but have a profile defined.
0 processes are in mixed mode.
```

**SELinux**: Experimental, not fully integrated, recent progress for
advanced/curious users; expect rough edges and manual intervention if you want
to try it. Most find SELinux more complex to configure and maintain than
AppArmor.

This isn't meant to be a comprehensive guide, more to get people thinking about
security on NixOS.
