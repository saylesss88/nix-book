It is highly recommended to harden your Host Machine to strengthen your opsec.

Whonix offers many benefits, including the convenience of running within your
current operating system without needing to reboot or use a separate Tails USB.
It provides similar strong anonymity protections by routing all traffic through
Tor in isolated virtual machines. The Whonix documentation is transparent about
its limitations, which helps build trust and confidence in its security model.

- [Whonix Compared to Tails](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others)

- Tails is great but they add an add blocker to Tor that makes every Tails user
  unique from the rest of Tor Browser users reducing anonymity.

> isn't secure a Virtual Machine won't protect you.

### Harden NixOS and set up GnuPG

- [Hardening NixOS](https://saylesss88.github.io/nix/hardening_NixOS.html)

- [Hardening Networking](https://saylesss88.github.io/nix/hardening_networking.html)

- [GnuPG and gpg-agent on NixOS](https://saylesss88.github.io/nix/gpg-agent.html)

### A Few Things to Consider when using Whonix

- You can anonymously use Java / Javascript

- No activity conducted inside `Whonix-Workstation` can cause IP/DNS leaks so
  long as `Whonix-Gateway` is left unchanged or only documented changes are made
  like configuring bridges, establishing onion services and running updates.

- Whonix does not and does not claim to protect users against advanced
  adversaries such as nation state actors, if they target you, you will be
  infected! If used correctly, Whonix can provide partial protection against
  passive surveillance programs, it all depends on whether Tor can provide
  adequate protection or not, which is not clear at this time.

- You shouldn't use a VPN with Whonix and it is obvious that you're using Tor
  because connections are made to known Tor Relays, which are publicly listed
  and identifiable.

> ⚠️It is impossible to Hide Tor use from the internet service provider (ISP).
> It has been concluded this goal is difficult beyond practicality.
> --[Whonix Hide Tor from your ISP](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hide_Tor_from_your_Internet_Service_Provider)

- Millions of people use Tor daily for wholly legitimate reasons, particularly
  to assert their privacy rights when faced with countless corporate /
  government network observers and censors.

## 🔑 Key Terms

Whonix is an operating system based on Debian base (Kicksecure Hardened) and the
Tor network, which is designed for maximum anonymity and security. Whonix
consists of two Debian based VMs, the `Whonix-Gateway` and `Whonix-Workstation`.

In this case NixOS is the **Host Operating System**, NixOS runs the KVM kernel
module, libvirtd service, and QEMU virtualization service which together enable
hosting VMs. It is recommended to harden the host before moving on.

**Guests** are the virtualized operating systems running inside the host's
virtual machines. In this case the Whonix VMs are the **Guest Machines**.

`Whonix-Gateway` the first of 2 VMs runs Tor processes and forces all traffic
through the Tor network using iptables.

`Whonix-Workstation` the second VM, is responsible for running user applications
such as the Tor Browser. The Whonix-Workstation is isolated from both the
Whonix-Gateway and the Host OS, if an app misbehaves, it is contained within the
isolated Whonix-Workstation. It is largely unaware of sensitive info and won't
leak unless an advanced adversary is able to break out of the VM.

The primary goal of Whonix is to be safer than Tor alone and that no one can
find out the user's IP, location, or de-anonymize the user. It offers full
spectrum anti-tracking protection that is much safer than VPNs. Whonix provides
this through security by isolation, no app is trusted.

`Whonix Concept`: Whonix is an Isolating Proxy with an additional Transparent
Proxy, which can be optionally disabled. --Whonix Docs

Since Whonix is based on Kicksecure which is based on Debian stable, you can
typically look up solutions in a Kicksecure, Debian, or Ubuntu forum.

- The Whonix Team recommends KVM over VirtualBox for a number of
  reasons:[Why choose KVM over VirtualBox](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM#Why_Use_KVM_Over_VirtualBox?)

If you really want to use VirtualBox, I got it working off of this config:

<details>
<summary> ✔️ Click to Expand VirtualBox Example </summary>

Change `your-user` to your username

```nix
# vbox.nix
{
  config,
  lib,
  ...
}: let
  cfg = config.custom.virtualbox;
in {
  options.custom.virtualbox = {
    enable = lib.mkEnableOption "Enable VirtualBox";
  };

  config = lib.mkIf cfg.enable {
    virtualisation.virtualbox.host = {
      enable = false;
      # enableExtensionPack = true;
    };

    user.user.your-user.extraGroups = ["vboxusers"];

    boot.kernelModules =
      if config.hardware.cpu.amd.updateMicrocode
      then ["kvm-amd"]
      else ["kvm-intel"];
  };
}
```

Enable it with `custom.virtualbox.enable = true;`.

- [Whonix VBox Download](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox)

After rebuilding with virtualbox enabled and downloading the virtualbox whonix,
open VirtualBox and import the Whonix file.

Fix the error:: VirtualBox can't enable the AMD-V extension. Please disable the
KVM kernel extension:

If both of these are active, they compete with each other:

```bash
sudo lsmod | grep -E 'kvm|vbox'
```

Check the currently in use modules:

```bash
modprobe -r kvm
```

Disable kvm and kvm_amd:

```bash
sudo rmmod kvm_amd
sudo rmmod kvm
# To re-enable them when necessary
# sudo modprobe kvm
# sudo modprobe kvm_amd
```

## Whonix-Gateway

The whonix-gateway is software designed to run Tor.

The Gateway acts as a firewall and is what is routing all your traffic through
Tor.

You will spend minimal time in the Gateway, it's mainly used for Tor
configuration which is reserved for advanced users.

### Whonix-Workstation

All user applications should only be launched from Whonix-Workstation to ensure
they utilize the Tor network. (Never launch the Tor browser or any other user
app from Whonix-Gateway.)

Leaky applications can't breakout of the Workstation, all network connections
are forced to go through the Whonix-Gateway where they are torrified and routed
to the internet.

## Whonix KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) on NixOS

**KVM** (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a Linux kernel module that provides
hardware-assisted virtualization.

It allows the Linux kernel to act as a hypervisor, enabling virtual machines
(VMs) to run with near-native speeds by using CPU virtualization extensions
(Intel VT-x or AMD-V).

KVM itself doesn’t handle the entire VM lifecycle; it provides the core
virtualization infrastructure.

**QEMU** (Quick Emulator) is an open-source user-space program that emulates
hardware for virtual machines.

When combined with KVM, QEMU uses hardware acceleration to run VMs much faster
by offloading CPU virtualization to KVM.

So, QEMU provides the device emulation and VM management interface, while KVM
provides the fast virtualization engine within the kernel.

**Install Qemu-KVM**:

```nix
{
  config,
  pkgs,
  ...
}: {
  ##  QEMU-KVM
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    qemu
    # Optional
    virt-viewer
  ];

  # Virt-Manager GUI
  programs.virt-manager.enable = true;
  virtualisation = {
    # libvirtd daemon
    libvirtd = {
      enable = true;
      qemu = {
        # enables a TPM emulator
        swtpm.enable = true;
      };
    };
    # allow USB device to be forwarded
    spiceUSBRedirection.enable = true;
  };
  # Spice protocol improves VM display and input responsiveness
  services.spice-vdagentd.enable = true;
}
```

---

The **libvirtd** is the primary daemon (service) in the libvirt virtualization
management system. It runs on your host machine and acts as the core management
component for virtual machines (VMs).

Add `libvirtd` & `kvm` to your users `extraGroups`:

```nix
users.users = {
    your-user = {
        extraGroups = [
            "libvirtd"
            "kvm"
        ];
    };
};
```

Restart `libvirtd`:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

---

## Network Start

Ensure KVM's / QEMU's default network is enabled and has started:

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-autostart default
```

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-start default
```

---

### Download Whonix (KVM) (stable)

1. [Whonix (KVM) (stable) Download](https://www.whonix.org/download/libvirt/17.4.4.6/Whonix-Xfce-17.4.4.6.Intel_AMD64.qcow2.libvirt.xz)

2. Go to [whoniix.org](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM) to verify the signature.
   Download the `OpenPGP Signature`, and the `Download Whonix OpenPGP Key`. Your
   Downloads directory will look like this:

```bash
~/Downloads󰏫 ls
╭───┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────╮
│ # │                         name                          │ type │  size   │   modified    │

╰───┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────╯
```

Import `derivative.asc`:

```bash
gpg --import derivative.asc
```

Verify the Public Key:

```bash
gpg --verify Whonix-Xfce-17.4.4.6.Intel_AMD64.qcow2.libvirt.xz.asc Whonix-Xfce-17.4.4.6.Intel_AMD64.qcow2.libvirt.xz
gpg: Signature made Sun 10 Aug 2025 09:04:13 AM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key 6E979B28A6F37C43BE30AFA1CB8D50BB77BB3C48
gpg: Good signature from "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@kicksecure.com>" [unknown]
gpg:                 aka "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>" [unknown]
gpg:                 aka "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@whonix.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!

~/Downloads󰏫                                                                                                 09/04/2025 11:53:10 AM
```

Now `gpg --list-keys` will show Patrick Schleizer's Key.

It is good practice to sign your verified key and then push it to the public
keyserver to contribute to the web of trust but optional.

3. [Decompress the Image](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM#Decompress) and follow
   the rest of the Whonix KVM install instructions from there.

Nixpkgs doesn't have the `xz-utils` package but it does have the `xz` package.

Nixpkgs also has `nixpkgs.safe-rm` if you wanted to follow the suggestions from
Whonix.

```bash
nix-shell -p xz safe-rm
```

```bash
tar -xvf Whonix*.libvirt.xz
```

---

### Import the Whonix VM Templates

The following commands come directly from the
[Whonix KVM Docs Importing Whonix VM Templates](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM#Importing_Whonix_VM_Templates)

1. Add the virtual networks. This step only needs to be done once and not with
   every upgrade.

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-define Whonix_external*.xml
```

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-define Whonix_internal*.xml
```

2. Activate the virtual networks:

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-autostart Whonix-External
```

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-start Whonix-External
```

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-autostart Whonix-Internal
```

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-start Whonix-Internal
```

3. Import the Whonix Gateway and Workstation images:

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system define Whonix-Gateway*.xml
```

```bash
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system define Whonix-Workstation*.xml
```

After the above steps, either copy or move the `qcow2` images to
`/var/lib/libvirt/images`:

> ❗ It's recommended to move the files into place, if you want to copy them you
> need to use a special command FYI.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/libvirt/images
```

```bash
sudo mv Whonix-Gateway*.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/Whonix-Gateway.qcow2
```

```bash
sudo mv Whonix-Workstation*.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/Whonix-Workstation.qcow2
```

### Cleanup

```bash
safe-rm Whonix*
```

```bash
safe-rm -r WHONIX*
```

### Launch virt-manager and start the VMs

```bash
virt-manager
```

From here it will take a bit to load both VMs, you can click on one and go to
`Edit`, `Virtual Machine Details` and from there you have some options to give
the VM more CPUs and memory.

Considering that the Whonix-Workstation is where all of the user applications
will be opened, it makes sense to give it more CPUs and memory.

## Start Whonix-Gateway

![Whonix Old Logo](../images/swappy-20250901-101351.cleaned.png)

Always start the Whonix-Gateway first.

Click on Whonix-Gateway, press Play, and choose the default Persistent VM.

To view the gateway press `Open`.

You can use the "System Maintenance Panel" to `Check for Updates` and then
`Install Updates`. This can also be used for user and password creation, the
default user is `user` with a passwordless login.

Change the password manually:

```bash
sudo passwd
changeme
```

Run a systemcheck if it wasn't run automatically. Click the Xfce Logo and go to
`System`, `System Check`.

- [Whonix Common CLI Commands](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Common_CLI_Commands)

## Whonix-Workstation

Whonix-Workstation is another VM, designed to provide users with a secure and
anonymous environment for running applications and performing online tasks.

When you first launch `Whonix-Workstation`, choose the second option down or
reboot, and then choose "Persistent Mode Sysmaint Session". From there, you can
go through the same steps as you did for the Gateway.

With the workstation, a security feature disables `sudo` for the default user.
Instead of the `user` account, a separate `sysmaint` (system maintenance)
account is used for administrative tasks that require root privileges, such as
updates and package installations.

After you get your system updated and upgraded, you'll want to reboot the
Workstation and start it in the first Persistent mode available rather than the
`sysmaint` mode.

Once Workstation is running and both VMs are updated and upgraded, check that
your IP address is a Tor IP:

```bash
curl ip.me
#
curl ip.me
```

Each consecutive time that you run `curl ip.me`, Tor establishes a new circuit
and you will get a different IP returned each time for as many Tor nodes are
available. Not that you would want to but it's cool functionality giving us a
visual of the new circuit.

Start Tor and check what you are fingerprinted as by typing `deviceinfo.me` into
the URL.

#### Launching Tor Browser

Click the Xfce logo and choose Tor Browser. On the first launch, you will need
to update Tor by clicking in the top right corner.

Or you can open the terminal and type:

```bash
update-torbrowser
```

- Every time you run the above command, the old browser will be killed, along
  with your old browser profile, including bookmarks and passwords. If the
  update suggests a downgrade from your current version don't do it, it is
  likely a downgrade attack.

Make sure you don't forget to go to the Settings, Privacy and Security, and set
the `Security Level` to `Safest` to disable JavaScript and more before exploring
the dark web.

Visit `https://check.torproject.org`, you should see "Congratulations. This
browser is configured to use Tor."

If you need a place to start, check out `https://tor.taxi` by plugging that into
the URL. Always include the `https` yourself!

> ❗ NOTE: Use HTTPS and TLS wherever possible, since Tor only encrypts traffic

## Live Mode

To get Whonix to perform more similarly to Tails you could run Whonix in Live
Mode. Live Mode is a privacy-focused mode where nothing is saved at shutdown,
making it great for handling sensitive data.

- [Live Mode](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Live_Mode)

Same process, reboot the Workstation and Choose
`LIVE Mode | USER Session | disposable use`
