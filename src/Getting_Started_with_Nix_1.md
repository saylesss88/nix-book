## Intro

Welcome to _nix-book_, an introductory book about Nix. This book leans more
towards using Flakes but will contrast traditional Nix where beneficial.
Originally, this content started as a blog. I'm refining its flow to make it
more cohesive.

In this chapter, I will touch on the different parts of the Nix ecosystem, give
a quick example of each and explain how they fit together.

The code blocks have an option to hide code, where I find it reasonable I will
hide the outputs of the expressions. Click the eye in the right corner of the
code block next to the copy clipboard.

Example click the eye to see hidden text:

```nix
{
  attrset = { a = 2; b = 4; };
~  hidden_set = { a = hidden; b = set; };

### Why Learn Nix?

The main reason to learn Nix is that it allows you to write declarative scripts
for reproducible software builds. Rather than mutate the global state and
install packages to a global location such as `/usr/bin` Nix stores packages in
the Nix store, usually the directory `/nix/store`, where each package has its
own unique subdirectory. This paradigm gives you some powerful features, such
as:

- Allowing multiple versions or variants of the same package at the same time.
  This prevents "DLL hell" from different applications having dependencies on
  different versions of the same package.

- Atomic upgrades: Upgrading or uninstalling an application cannot break other
  applications and either succeed completely or fail completely preventing
  partial upgrades breaking your system. The nix store is immutable preventing
  package management operations from overwriting other packages. They wouldn't
  overwrite each other anyways because the hashing scheme ensures that new
  versions or repeat packages end up at different paths.

- Nix is designed to provide hermetic builds that aren't affected by the
  environment, this helps you make sure that when packaging software that the
  dependencies are complete because they must be explicitly declared as inputs.
  With other package managers it is more difficult to be sure that an
  environment variable or something in your `$PATH` isn't affecting your build.

Let’s dive into the key characteristics of Nix:

| Concept          | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pure**         | Functions don't cause side effects.                           |
| **Functional**   | Functions can be passed as arguments and returned as results. |
| **Lazy**         | Not evaluated until needed to complete a computation.         |
| **Declarative**  | Describing a system outcome.                                  |
| **Reproducible** | Operations that are performed twice return same results       |

> ❗ Important: In Nix, everything is an expression, there are no statements.
>
> ❗ Important: Values in Nix are immutable.

### The Nix Ecosystem

The **Nix Language** is the foundation of the ecosystem and is used to write
**Nix Expressions**.

Example of a simple nix expression:

```nix
{ hello = "world"; }
# or
"foo" + "bar"
```

While the Nix language provides the foundation for writing expressions, it is
only part of the ecosystem. These expressions become powerful when used within
the Nix Package Manager, which evaluates and realizes them into tangible
software builds and system configurations. This is where Nixpkgs and NixOS come
into play.

### The Nix Package Manager, Nixpkgs, and NixOS

At the heart of the Nix ecosystem is **Nix Package Manager**. This powerful
engine is responsible for orchestrating the entire process: taking **Nix
expressions** (like _package definitions_ and _configuration modules_),
evaluating them into precise _derivations_, executing their build steps (the
_realization phase_), and meticulously managing the immutable Nix store.

A cornerstone of the Nix ecosystem is **Nixpkgs**. This vast collection
comprises tens of thousands of Nix expressions that describe how to build a wide
array of software packages from source. Nixpkgs is more than just a package
repository—it also contains **NixOS Modules**, declarative configurations that
define system behavior, ensuring a structured and reproducible environment.
These modules enable users to declaratively describe a Linux system, with each
module contributing to the desired state of the overall system by leveraging
_package definitions_ and _derivations_. This is how NixOS emerges: it is quite
simply the natural consequence of applying the Nix philosophy to building an
entire Linux operating system.

We will further expand our understanding of modules in
[Chapter 3](https://saylesss88.github.io/NixOS_Modules_Explained_3.html)

The following is an example of a NixOS module that is part of the `nixpkgs`
collection:

```nix
# nixpkgs/nixos/modules/programs/zmap.nix
{
  pkgs,
  config,
  lib,
  ...
}:

let
  cfg = config.programs.zmap;
in
{
  options.programs.zmap = {
    enable = lib.mkEnableOption "ZMap, a network scanner designed for Internet-wide network surveys";
  };

  config = lib.mkIf cfg.enable {
    environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.zmap ];

    environment.etc."zmap/blacklist.conf".source = "${pkgs.zmap}/etc/zmap/blacklist.conf";
    environment.etc."zmap/zmap.conf".source = "${pkgs.zmap}/etc/zmap.conf";
  };
}
```

- This module, `programs.zmap.nix`, demonstrates how NixOS configurations work.
  It defines an enable option for the ZMap network scanner. If enabled by the
  user in their system configuration, the module ensures the `zmap` package is
  installed and its default configuration files are placed in `/etc`, allowing
  ZMap to be managed declaratively as part of the operating system.
  - When `nixpkgs` is imported (e.g., in a NixOS configuration), the
    configuration options and settings defined by its modules (like
    `programs.zmap.nix`) become available for use, typically accessed via dot
    notation (e.g., `config.programs.zmap.enable`). This ability to make such a
    huge set of modules and packages readily available without a significant
    performance penalty is due to Nix's **lazy evaluation**; only the
    expressions required for a particular build or configuration are actually
    evaluated.

  - Most of the time you'll simply [search](https://search.nixos.org/packages)
    to see if the package is already included in `nixpkgs` and follow the
    instructions there to get it on your system. It is good practice to first
    search for the [options](https://search.nixos.org/options?) to see what
    configurable settings are available, and then proceed to search for the
    package itself if you know it exists or if you need its specific package
    definition. When you look up the options for Zmap, `programs.zmap.enable` is
    all that is listed in this example.

  - Home Manager uses the same underlying Nix module system as NixOS, and when
    you do something like home.packages = with pkgs; you are referring to the
    same package derivations from nixpkgs as you would with
    `environment.systemPackages`. However, Home Manager's own configuration
    modules (e.g., for `programs.zsh` or `git`) are distinct and reside in the
    Home Manager repository, designed for user-specific configurations.

One of the main differentiating aspects of Nix, as opposed to traditional
package managers, is this concept that package builds are treated as pure
functions. This functional paradigm ensures consistency and reproducibility,
which are core tenets of the Nix philosophy.

Nix expressions permeate the ecosystem—everything in Nix is an expression,
including the next key components: package definitions and derivations.

### Package Definitions & Derivations

**Package Definitions** are specialized expressions that tell Nix how to build
software.

Example of a package definition:

```nix
# hello.nix
{pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}}:
pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "hello";
  version = "2.12.1";

  src = pkgs.fetchurl {
    url = "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.12.1.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "086vqwk2wl8zfs47sq2xpjc9k066ilmb8z6dn0q6ymwjzlm196cd";
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = [pkgs.autoconf pkgs.automake pkgs.gcc];

  configurePhase = ''
    ./configure --prefix=$out
  '';

  buildPhase = ''
    make
  '';

  installPhase = ''
    make install
  '';
}
```

1. **Evaluation Phase**:

Now when you run something like:

```bash
nix-instantiate hello.nix
warning: you did not specify '--add-root'; the result might be removed by the garbage collector
/nix/store/p2hbg16a9kpqgx2nzcsq39wmnyxyq4jy-hello-2.12.1.drv
```

- Nix evaluates the expression and produces a `.drv` file (the **derivation**),
  a precise JSON-like blueprint describing how the package will be built. It
  does not contain the built software itself.

2. **Realization Phase**:

When you run:

```bash
nix-build hello.nix
#...snip...
shrinking RPATHs of ELF executables and libraries in /nix/store/53hqyw72dijq3wb5kc0ln04g681gk6cp-hello-2.12.1
shrinking /nix/store/53hqyw72dijq3wb5kc0ln04g681gk6cp-hello-2.12.1/bin/hello
checking for references to /build/ in /nix/store/53hqyw72dijq3wb5kc0ln04g681gk6cp-hello-2.12.1...
gzipping man pages under /nix/store/53hqyw72dijq3wb5kc0ln04g681gk6cp-hello-2.12.1/share/man/
patching script interpreter paths in /nix/store/53hqyw72dijq3wb5kc0ln04g681gk6cp-hello-2.12.1
stripping (with command strip and flags -S -p) in  /nix/store/53hqyw72dijq3wb5kc0ln04g681gk6cp-hello-2.12.1/bin
/nix/store/53hqyw72dijq3wb5kc0ln04g681gk6cp-hello-2.12.1
```

- Nix realizes the derivation by actually executing the build steps, fetching
  sources, compiling (if needed), and producing the final result (typically
  stored in e.g. `/nix/store/53hqyw72dijq3wb5kc0ln04g681gk6cp-hello-2.12.1`)

- `nix-build` also creates a symlink named `result` in your current directory,
  pointing to the final build output in the Nix store.

3. Execute the program:

```bash
./result/bin/hello
Hello, world!
```

`result/bin/hello` points to the executable inside the output of the
derivation.The derivation describes how the package is built, but does not
include the final binaries.

To say that another way, the derivation is not the executable. The executable is
one of the derivations `outputs`. When Nix "realizes" a derivation, it executes
those build instructions, and the result is the actual built software, which
gets placed into its own unique path in the Nix store.

A single derivation can produce multiple outputs. The executable is typically
part of the `out` output, specifically in its `bin` directory.

Here is a small snippet of what a `.drv` file could look like, I got this from
building the hello derivation and running the following on the store path:

```bash
nix show-derivation /nix/store/9na8mwp5zaprikqaqw78v6cdn1rxac7i-hello-2.12.1
```

```nix
{
  "/nix/store/871398c9cbskmzy6bvfnynr8yrlh7nk0-hello-2.12.1.drv": {
    "args": [
      "-e",

#### Conclusion

In this introductory chapter, we've laid the groundwork for understanding the
powerful Nix ecosystem. We explored how the Nix Language forms the declarative
bedrock, enabling us to define desired system states and software builds as
expressions. You saw how the Nix Package Manager orchestrates this process,
transforming those expressions into precise derivations during the evaluation
phase, and then faithfully "realizing" them into reproducible, isolated
artifacts within the immutable `/nix/store`.

We also introduced the vast Nixpkgs collection, which provides tens of thousands
of package definitions and forms the foundation for NixOS — a fully declarative
operating system built on these principles—and even user-level configurations
like those managed by Home Manager. This unique functional approach, with its
emphasis on immutability and lazy evaluation, is what enables Nix's promises of
consistency, atomic upgrades, and truly hermetic builds, fundamentally changing
how we think about software and system management.
