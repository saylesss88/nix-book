## Intro to Nushell on NixOS

- **TL;DR**:I recently switched default shells from zsh to nushell, this post is
  about some of the challenges and advantages of using nushell with NixOS.

- While the average user might not immediately see significant advantages, those
  who frequently work with structured data formats like JSON, YAML, and CSV –
  such as developers interacting with APIs, system administrators managing
  configurations, and data professionals – will likely find Nushell's native
  data handling and powerful pipeline capabilities a plus. Additionally, users
  who value a more consistent and safer scripting experience might appreciate
  Nushell's language-first design and features like strong typing.

- I'll start with some of the unique build design choices and unique features
  that I think make Nushell special, then show an example using Nushell to
  manipulate JSON data. Finally, I will highlight some of the visually appealing
  aspects of Nushell and lastly I share some resources for learning more.

## The Good

- Nushell borrows concepts from many shells and languages and is itself both a
  programming language and a shell. Because of this, it has its own way of
  working with files, directories, websites, and more.

- Nushell is powerful and has many essential commands built directly into the
  shell ("internal" commands) rather than a link to an executable. You can use
  this set of commands across different operating systems, having this
  consistency is helpful when creating cross-platform code.

- When internal Nushell commands (like `ls`, `open`, `where`, `get`, `sort-by`,
  etc.) produce output, they generally do so in Nushell's structured data format
  (tables or records). This is the shell's native way of representing
  information.

- Beyond these foundational strengths, Nushell offers a range of unique features
  that enhance its functionality and make it particularly well-suited for
  data-heavy tasks. Here are some highlights that showcase its versatility.

**Some Unique Features**:

- Besides the built-in commands, Nushell has a
  [standard library](https://www.nushell.sh/book/standard_library.html) Nushell
  operates on _structured data_. You could call it a "data-first" shell and
  programming language.

- Also included, is a full-featured dataframe processing engine using
  [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) if you want to process large data
  efficiently directly in your shell, check out the
  [Dataframes-Docs](https://www.nushell.sh/book/dataframes.html)

- **Multi-Line Editing**:

- When writing a long command you can press Enter to add a newline and move to
  the next line. For example:

```nu
ls            |    # press enter
where name =~ |    # press enter, comments after pipe ok
get name      |    # press enter
mv ...$in ./backups/
```

- This allows you to cycle through the entire multi-line command using the up
  and down arrow keys and then customize different lines or sections of the
  command.

- You can manually insert a newline using `Alt+Enter` or `Shift+Enter`.

- The [Reedline-Editor](https://www.nushell.sh/book/line_editor.html) is
  powerful and provides good `vi-mode` or `emacs` support built in.

- It's default `Ctrl+r` history command is nice to work with out of the box.

- The [explore](https://www.nushell.sh/book/explore.html#parameters) command, is
  nu's version of a table pager, just like `less` but for table structured data:

```nu
$nu | explore --peek
```

- With the above command you can navigate with vim keybinds or arrow keys.

- These features demonstrate Nushell’s user-friendly interface, but what truly
  sets it apart is its underlying design as a structured data scripting
  language. This “language-first” approach powers many of its distinctive
  capabilities.

![explore](images/explore.png)

**Unique design**:

- **Fundamentally designed as a structured data scripting language**: and then
  it acts as a shell on top of that foundation. This "language first" approach
  is what gives it many of its distinctive features and makes it a powerful
  scripting language. I reiterate this here because of the implications of this.
  A few of those features are:
  - **Pipelines of structured data**: Unlike traditional shells that primarily
    deal with plain text streams, Nushell pipelines operate on tables of
    structured data. Each command can understand and manipulate this structured
    data directly.

  - **Consistent syntax**: Its syntax is more consistent and predictable
    compared to the often quirky syntax of Bash and Zsh, drawing inspiration
    from other programming languages.

  - **Strong typing** Nushell has a type system, which helps catch errors early
    and allows for more robust scripting.

  - **First-class data types**: It treats various data formats (like JSON, CSV,
    TOML) as native data types, making it easier to work with them. Because of
    this, Nushell aims to replace the need for external tools like `jq`, `awk`,
    `sed`, `cut`, and even some uses of `grep` and `curl`.

- **Variables are Immutable by Default**: Nushell's commands are based on a
  functional-style of programming which requires immutability, sound familiar?

- **Nushell's Environment is Scoped**: Nushell takes many design cues from
  compiled languages, one is that languages should avoid global mutable state.
  Shells have commonly used global mutation to update the environment, Nushell
  attempts to steer clear of this increasing reproducability.

- **Single-use Environment Variables**:

```nu
FOO=BAR $env.FOO
# => BAR
```

- **Permanent Environment Variables**: In your `config.nu`

```nu
# config.nu
$env.FOO = 'BAR'
```

- [Coming-From-Bash](https://www.nushell.sh/book/coming_from_bash.html)

- These design principles make Nushell a powerful tool for scripting, but
  they’re best understood through a hands-on example. Let’s see how Nushell’s
  structured data capabilities shine in a common task: processing a JSON file.

**Example**: I wanted to provide a practical example to illustrate some of these
"Good" features in action. And break it down for better understanding.

- Let's consider a common task: processing data from a JSON file. Imagine you
  have a file containing a list of users with their names and ages. With
  traditional shells, you'd likely need to rely on external tools like `jq` to
  parse and filter this data. However, Nushell can handle this directly within
  its own commands.

- For this example you could create a `test` directory and move to it:

```bash
mkdir test ; cd test
```

- Create a `users.json` with the following contents:

👇 users.json

```json
[
  { "name": "Alice", "age": 25 },
  { "name": "Bob", "age": 30 },
  { "name": "Charlie", "age": 20 }
]
```

- And create the following `filter.nu` that first converts `users.json` into its
  own internal structured data format with the `open` command, then to filters
  out people under `21` with the `where` control flow construct, then selects
  the `name` and `age` columns, sorts them by age, and finally converts them
  back to `json` and saves them to a file called `filtered_users.json`. A lot
  happening in a 6 line script.

```nu
# filter.nu
open users.json           # Read JSON file into structured data
| where age > 21         # Filter users older than 21
| select name age        # Select only name and age columns
| sort-by age            # Sort by age
| to json                # Convert back to JSON
| save filtered_users.json # Save result to a new file
```

- The `open` command takes data from a file (or even a URL in some cases) and
  parses it and converts it into Nushells own internal structured data format.
  So this command isn't just showing you the contents of `users.json` but doing
  a conversion to Nu's special structured format.

```nu
open users.json
╭───┬─────────┬─────╮
│ # │  name   │ age │
├───┼─────────┼─────┤
│ 0 │ Alice   │  25 │
│ 1 │ Bob     │  30 │
│ 2 │ Charlie │  20 │
╰───┴─────────┴─────╯
```

- The `source` command in Nushell is used to execute the commands within a
  script file (like `filter.nu`) in the current Nushell environment. It's
  similar to running the script directly in the shell, but keeps the shell open
  for further use. In this example, `source filter.nu` runs the commands inside
  `filter.nu`, processing the `users.json` file and creating the
  `filtered_users.json` file:

```nu
source filter.nu
# View the contents with bat
bat filtered_users.json
───────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       │ File: filtered_users.json
───────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1   │ [
   2   │   {
   3   │     "name": "Alice",
   4   │     "age": 25
   5   │   },
   6   │   {
   7   │     "name": "Bob",
   8   │     "age": 30
   9   │   }
  10   │ ]
───────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

- As you can see, without needing any external tools, Nushell was able to read,
  filter, select, sort, and then re-serialize JSON data using a clear and
  concise pipeline. This demonstrates its power in handling structured data
  natively, making common data manipulation tasks within the shell significantly
  more streamlined and readable compared to traditional approaches.

**In the filter.nu example:**

```nu
# filter.nu
open users.json           # Read JSON file into structured data
| where age > 21         # Filter users older than 21
| select name age        # Select only name and age columns
| sort-by age            # Sort by age
| to json                # Convert back to JSON
| save filtered_users.json # Save result to a new file
```

<details>
<summary> ✔️ Summary of above Command (Click to Expand)</summary>

1. `open users.json`: Produces a **Nushell table** representing the data.

2. `| where age > 21`: Receives the table, filters rows based on the `age`
   column, and outputs a new, filtered table.

3. `| select name age`: Receives the filtered table, selects only the `name` and
   `age` columns, and outputs a table with fewer columns.

4. `| sort-by age`: Receives the table, sorts the rows based on the `age`
   column, and outputs a sorted table.

5. `| to json`: Receives the sorted table and converts it back into JSON text.

6. `| save filtered_users.json`: Receives the JSON text and saves it to a file.

- So, while the concept of piping is the same, the nature of the data flowing
  through the Nushell pipeline is richer and more structured, enabling more
  powerful and direct data manipulation.

- While Nushell’s strengths, like its structured data pipelines, make it a
game-changer for many tasks, it’s not without its challenges, especially when
integrated with NixOS’s Bash-centric ecosystem. Let’s explore some of the
limitations you might encounter when adopting Nushell as your default shell.
</details>

### The Bad

- While the project is still maturing, the active community and ongoing
  improvements are promising. Don't get too discouraged by the following, there
  would be a bad section for any shell imo.
- There are many similarities so it can be easy to forget that some Bash (and
  POSIX in general) style constructs just won't work in Nushell. Considering
  that NixOS seems to have been designed for bash, even Zsh isn't fully
  compatable you may want to think twice before you choose Nushell as your
  default.

- The documentation is incomplete and written by devs for devs imo, it is quite
  a bit different from anything else I've seen so there is a bit of a learning
  curve. Nushell is generally still considered to be in a stage where it might
  not be the most seamless or trouble-free experience as a daily driver default
  shell for most users, especially on a system like NixOS known for its unique
  approach.

- The [any-nix-shell](https://github.com/haslersn/any-nix-shell) project doesn't
  include Nushell as with many others because of it's lack of maturity.

- The following addition comes from Joey_McKur's sugggestion, on mentioning the
  `job` command as one of the biggest criticisms against Nu because it doesn't
  support background tasks. I should also note that Nushell's team is aware of
  these criticisms and actively working on improving job control.

**Limited Feature Set Compared to Traditional Job Control:**

- **Lack of Full POSIX Job Control**: Nushell's job control doesn't yet fully
  implement all the features and signals defined by POSIX job control (e.g.,
  more nuanced signal handling, stopped jobs). While it covers the basics, users
  accustomed to advanced Bash job control might find it lacking.

- **Foregrounding Behavior**: There have been criticisms about how foregrounding
  jobs interacts with the terminal and potential issues with signal propagation.

**Output Handling Challenges**:

- **Interleaved Output**: Managing the output of multiple backgrounded jobs can
  sometimes be messy, with output from different jobs potentially interleaving
  in the terminal. While Nushell tries to handle this, it's not always as clean
  as desired.

- **Redirection Complexity**: Redirecting the input and output of backgrounded
  jobs can be less straightforward than in Bash, sometimes requiring more
  explicit handling.

**Integration with Pipelines:**

- **Backgrounding Pipelines**: Backgrounding complex pipelines with multiple
  stages can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or difficulties in managing
  the entire pipeline as a single job.

**Error Reporting:**

- **Difficult to Track Errors in Background Jobs**: Identifying and debugging
  errors in backgrounded jobs can be less direct than with foreground processes,
  and the job command's output might not always provide sufficient information
  for troubleshooting.

- Many of Nushell’s challenges stem from its departure from traditional shell
  conventions, particularly those of Bash, which NixOS heavily relies on. To
  better understand these differences and how they impact your workflow, let’s
  compare Nushell’s static, structured approach to Bash’s dynamic, text-based
  model.

### Key Differences Between Nushell & Bash

| **Feature**        | **Bash (Dynamic)**        | **Nushell (Static)**                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Code Execution     | Line-by-line              | Whole script parsed first                     |
| Error Detection    | Runtime errors only       | Catches errors before running                 |
| Support for `eval` | ✅ Allowed                | ❌ Not supported                              |
| Custom Parsing     | Limited                   | Built-in semantic analysis                    |
| IDE Features       | Basic syntax highlighting | Advanced integration, linting, and formatting |

- `&&` doesn't work use `;` instead.

- `>` is used as the greater-than operator for comparisons:

```nu
"hello" | save output.txt
```

is equivalent to the following in bash:

```bash
echo "hello" > output.txt
```

- If you notice above the nushell command doesn't require an `echo` prefix, this
  is because Nushell has **Implicit Return**:

```nu
"Hello, World" == (echo "Hello, World")
# => true
```

- The above example shows that the string, `"Hello, World"` is equivalent to the
  output value from `echo "Hello, World"`

- **Every Command Returns a Value**:

```nu
let p = 7
print $p  # 7
$p * 6    # 42
```

- Understanding these differences highlights why Nushell feels so distinct from
  Bash, but it’s the shell’s advanced features and integrations that truly make
  it shine. Let’s dive into some of the beautiful and powerful tools and custom
  commands that elevate Nushell for NixOS users.

### The Beautiful and Powerful

- These custom Nushell commands showcase its flexibility, but sometimes you need
  to work around Nushell’s limitations, like compatability with certain NixOS
  tools. This is where `just` and `justfiles` come in, simplifying complex
  workflows and bridging gaps in Nushell’s functionality.

## Using Just and Justfiles

- The following is my `justfile` that I keep right next to my `flake.nix` it
  simplifies some commands and makes things work that weren't working with
  nushell for my case, you'll have to change it to match your configuration.
  It's not perfect but works for my use case, take whats useful and leave the
  rest.

- You'll first need to install [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to make use
  of `justfiles`.

```bash
# nix shell nixpkgs#just nixpkgs#nushell
set shell := ["nu", "-c"]
flake_path := "/home/jr/flake"
hostname := "magic"
home_manager_output := "jr@magic"

utils_nu := absolute_path("utils.nu")

default:
    @just --list
# Rebuild
[group('nix')]
fr:
    nh os switch --hostname {{hostname}} {{flake_path}}

# Flake Update
[group('nix')]
fu:
    nh os switch  --hostname {{hostname}} --update {{flake_path}}

# Update specific input
# Usage: just upp nixpkgs
[group('nix')]
upp input:
    nix flake update {{input}}
# Test
[group('nix')]
ft:
    nh os test --hostname {{hostname}} {{flake_path}}
# Collect Garbage
[group('nix')]
ncg:
    nix-collect-garbage --delete-old ; sudo nix-collect-garbage -d ; sudo /run/current-system/bin/switch-to-configuration boot

[group('nix')]
cleanup:
    nh clean all

```

- To list available commands type, (you must be in the same directory as the
  justfile): `just`

![just](images/just2.png)

- So `just fmt` will run `nix fmt`.

- A lot of the `.nu` files came from this repo by BlindFS:
  - [modern-dot-files](https://github.com/blindFS/modern-dot-files/tree/main) he
    uses Nix Darwin so there are a few changes for NixOS. I found this through
    [this_week_in_nu](https://github.com/nushell/this_week_in_nu).

  - [my-nu-config](https://github.com/TSawyer87/flakes/tree/main/homeManagerModules/shells/nushell)
    If you use this, you'll need to change the first line of `fzf.nu` to the
    location of your config. You'll also need to change the constants at the top
    of `config.nu`. These are my old dotfiles, I have recently updated and made
    sure this config is up to date with recent nushell changes. Also, change the
    `let flake_path = ($env.HOME | path join "flake")` to your flake path.

  - The examples use this starship
    config[Aylur-dotfiles](https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles/blob/main/home/starship.nix)
    The logic on the bottom enables starship for Nushell, Zsh, and Bash!

  - If you wan't to use my config you'll have to enable the experimental-feature
    `pipe-operators` in the same place you enable flakes and nix-command.

- There are still situations where I need to switch to zsh or bash to get
  something to work i.e. `nix-shell` and a few others.

- From custom commands to `justfile` integrations, Nushell offers a wealth of
  tools to enhance your NixOS experience, even if occasional workarounds are
  needed. To dive deeper into Nushell and tailor it to your needs, here are some
  valuable resources to explore, from official documentation to community-driven
  configurations.
